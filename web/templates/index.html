    Hello and welcome to my very own corner of the interweave.
    <br />
    <br />
    This corner is a lot of things. It's a convenient way to check the statuses
    of the services I'm running. It's an index of my projects and writings. It
    hosts a list of links, leading either to my presence in the other places on
    the internet or to destinations distinct. Finally, there's the files I host
    which are free to download.
    <br />
    <br />
    But also, the website is the first iteration in a *while* that (almost)
    doesn't use JavaScript as a development tool. The files are served as part
    of my API, statically. It uses Zola as an SSG and Tailwind, because the
    convenience is too great to go back to writing CSS in a hobby project.
