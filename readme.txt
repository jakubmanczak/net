manczak.net

This is the source code of my website. It runs as a Rust compiled binary and takes
care of most everything. Currently not compiling on Windows, because I don't need it to.

Feature plan:
* About/Overview
    * Project/blog/writing amalgamation pages
    * Funky splash text cannon
* Machine statues & load, game server load reporting
    * TF2/Source Server Query, Minecraft Server Query
    * Subproject: server status reporting binary
* Secure file tree hosting (secret files?)
* Link shortening, bookmarks
